# TryingOutSortingAlgo
Sorting algo are classified on the basis of below categories : 
1 - Time complexity
2 - Space Complexity
3 - Stability
4 - Internal or External Sort 
5 - Recursive or Non recursive
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Selection Sort : - It is an inplace unstable sorting algorithm.It is unstable because of the swap at last which might change the order of relative position of the number.Here the major idea is to select any min no index for first time then in every iteration the min number found is place in the ith place.
Time Complexity : 
Best - O(n^2)  Worst - O(n^2)  Avg - O(n^2)
Space Complexity :
O(1)
